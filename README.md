# Parametric-Bottle

The proposed code makes it possible to generate different types and sizes of 3D bottles in order to train [Pixel2mesh algorithm](https://github.com/nywang16/Pixel2Mesh) on these synthetic data and adapt it to reconstruct 3D shapes of bottles using a single RGB image input. Check the results for different parameters: [Bottle 1](https://github.com/y-aoub/Parametric-Bottle/blob/main/btl1.stl), [Bottle 2](https://github.com/y-aoub/Parametric-Bottle/blob/main/btl2.stl) and [Bottle 3](https://github.com/y-aoub/Parametric-Bottle/blob/main/btl3.stl).
